# Choose your environment

To complete this tutorial, you can choose between two possibilities:

- Clone the forked repository on your machine and work locally (i.e. outside the web browser)

    You can simply clone the repository using your SSH key, use your favorite IDE to modify the files and finally commit and push the changes to test them

- Clone the forked repository in the katacoda environment and work in the web browser

    You can clone the repository in the katacoda shell using the HTTPS link. Then work on the provided VSCODE editor. To be able to commit and push the code, you need to generate an authorization token in your GitHub account settings. Please follow [this tutorial](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token) to generate the access token. Note: make sure to select the *repo* section in the permissions. Afterwards, each time you want to push, you need to specify your GitHub username and give the access token as password.

    Note: Git could ask you to set the global settings such as the username and the email, if it is the case, just execute the commands given by Git, for instance:
    ```
    git config --global user.name "yourName"
    ```
