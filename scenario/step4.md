# NPM vs Yarn

Let's talk about the choice of the package manager. The two most popular are `npm` and `yarn`.

The most interesting difference considered for this tutorial is the package installation speed. Indeed, `yarn` installs packages in parallel while `npm` installs them sequentially. Therefore this feature should help you to speed your workflows.

Note: depending on your needs, the choice of the package manager should not only be based on the speed capacity, see the resources below for further information about the difference between the two package managers.

# Practical part

The project already use `yarn` as package manager, therefore there is nothing practical to do for this step.
