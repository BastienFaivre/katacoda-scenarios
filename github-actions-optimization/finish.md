That's it! Hopefully you learned a couple of techniques to improve your GitHub Actions!

# Take-home message

- Avoid doing reaching out to third-parties over the network by caching.
- Experiment with what works best for **your** project! Some "improvements" may introduce too much overhead to be effective.
- If test-suites are slow, you can try to only run the affected tests.
  - Be aware of weird behavior, you are making a trade-off between being sure that you are correct and speed.
- If you have a unique problem to solve in a pipeline, look for a thrid-party action that solves it.
  - There are loads of actions out there, it is likely that someone has encountered the same problem as you.

## Further Learning
